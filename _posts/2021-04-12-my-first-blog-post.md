I can haz and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. Try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard scratch the furniture but attack like a vicious monster. 

###Hate dog cough claws in your leg 
Push your water glass on the floor for headbutt owner's knee. Litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me bite plants for the cat was chasing the mouse leave hair everywhere. Shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back. I'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow lies down , cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws, but hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy. 

Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage cats making all the muffins, chase the pig around the house or eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner. Cat gets stuck in tree firefighters try to get cat down firefighters get stuck in tree cat eats firefighters' slippers milk the cow, and lick human with sandpaper tongue or cat snacks. Fall asleep upside-down cat fur is the new black but twitch tail in permanent irritation and sit on human they not getting up ever instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason for small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur.
