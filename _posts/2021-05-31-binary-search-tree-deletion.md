Code that lazy-deletes and hard deletes nodes in Binary Search Tree. Traverses tree and when searching for particular node, is able to differentiate between not deleted, lazy-deleted and hard deleted nodes. 

#### What was challenging
understanding and working around nodes deleted in the middle of a tree and still be able to find nodes after the deleted node.

#### What I learned
Working in and travering trees is quite the brain workout. Working with lazy delete vs hard delete (garbage collection) where with the first I just had to work around it but with the latter I had to connect the before and after of the deleted node.
