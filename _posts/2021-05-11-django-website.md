Created a Tool Sharing plus Neighborhood site using Django's tools to create a skeleton website and application. Create models to represent the application's different data. Use the Django admin site to populate your site's data. Create views to retrieve specific data in response to different requests, and templates to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser. Create mappers to associate different URL patterns with specific views. Add user authorization and sessions to control site behavior and access. And work with forms.

#### What was challenging
Understanding how the different parts: models, views, urls, admin pages control different parts of the site and how they work together.
