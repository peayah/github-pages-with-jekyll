The class exercise was part of a multi week project building a machine learning application without using any python libraries.

The Tutorial is doing the same thing just with python libraries numpy, pandas, joblib, io and matplotlib.

#### What was challenging
For the class project, the challenge was understanding how the different functions fed into eachother, and what the individual function returned - in other words how the data flowed.

#### What I learned
Working on these projects showed me the mechanics of machine leaning becasue we either had to code functions ourselves or understand the flow in an instructor given function in order to make our own functions work.
