The exercise was to come up with a function that travels through a maze built from lists and add edges to the coordinates. It would then be fed into a Dijkstra function what found the shortest path. Then I needed to get the coordinates from the shortest path so I could print the shortest path in the maze but also print the solution, a list of coordinates. 

    [(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), 
    (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), 
    (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), 
    (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), 
    (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), 
    (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), 
    (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)] [(5, 0), 
    (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1),
