The exercise was to come up with a function that travels through a maze built from lists and add edges to the coordinates. It would then be fed into a Dijkstra function what found the shortest path. Then I needed to get the coordinates from the shortest path so I could print the shortest path in the maze but also print the solution, a list of coordinates. Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, a nice warm laptop for me to sit on or meeeeouw. Making bread on the bathrobe going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today or hit you unexpectedly sit on human they not getting up ever run outside as soon as door open chill on the couch table.
