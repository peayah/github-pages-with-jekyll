Created a function that solve a subset sum problem for any list of integers and a predetermined total. Am able to use to find the optimal combination of integers from a given list to either get close to or hit a total. Could be used to select the optimal combination of packages of different weights to hit a max weight or find a combination of songs that to fill a predetermined runtime.  

#### What was challenging
working out the algorithm and the order in which the different calculstions should happen.

#### What I learned
Although the example was just an array of integers and a target number, I realized the many uses for subset sum set up.
