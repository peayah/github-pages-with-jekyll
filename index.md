Time stands still when code.

I’m a full-stack python developer with industry experience in building websites and working with data in various ways.

I have also taken classes in Database Management and Data Visualization and have April 2021 handed in the final assignment in my last programming class; Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms at Foothill College. As I’m finishing my CS degree, I’d like to start working as a programmer instead of sneaking a few hours after a full day at work.
