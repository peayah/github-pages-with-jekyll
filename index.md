## A Paragraph About Me
I'm always up for a good discussion both to challenge my own beliefs and to learn something new. During the past two years I've set up multiple book discussion (discussing a chapter a week) and arranged monthly speakers on a variety of topics within San Francisco Mensa. Generally, I will also loan my organizing and/or design skills to a non-profit. Currently, I'm in the process of moving a band booster website to WordPress.
