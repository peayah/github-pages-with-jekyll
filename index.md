Time stands still when I code.

I’m a full-stack python developer with industry experience in building websites and working with data in various ways.

I have also taken classes in Database Management and Data Visualization and have April 2021 handed in the final assignment in my last programming class; Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms at Foothill College. As I’m finishing my CS degree, I’d like to start working as a programmer instead of sneaking a few hours after a full day at work.

Constantly Learning — Consistently Problem Solving — Constructively Coding

## Skills
Database Coding: Python, R, SQL
Data Manipulation and Visualization: Tableau, Excel
Web Coding: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Projects
Here is are a few code samples. More at [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/peayah).

### Subset Sum

*Language* - Python.  
*My contribution* - Solo (Class Project)

Created a function that solve a subset sum problem for any list of integers and a predetermined total. Am able to use to find the optimal combination of integers from a given list to either get close to or hit a total. Could be used to select the optimal combination of packages of different weights to hit a max weight or find a combination of songs that to fill a predetermined runtime.

### Maze Solution Finder

*Language* - Python.  
*My contribution* - Solo (Class Project)

A function that travels through a maze built from lists to add edges that when fed into Dijkstra will find shortest path. And also print a list the coordinates the maze traveller has to pass through to get from start to finish. Class Project. Code upon request.

### Binary Search Tree Deletion

*Language* - Python.  
*My contribution* - Solo (Class Project)

Description: Code that lazy-delete in Binary Search Trees. Traverses tree and is able to differentiate between not deleted, lazy-deleted and hard deleted nodes.
